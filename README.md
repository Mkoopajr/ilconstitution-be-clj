# ilconstitution-clj

As of right now this is a really bad test project I'm using to help learn Clojure.
Some of the things that are wrong with it include hardcoded paths, duplicated code,
unused dependencies, as well as a host of other things.
I just need to get this base stored in github, and will be fixing these things as I move
forward.
